  <h4>Introduction to HTML and CSS</h4>

  <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web
    browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as
    JavaScript.</p>

  <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style sheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document
    written in HTML. CSS describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.
  </p>

  <h5>Why use HTML?</h5>
  <p>HTML is pivotal to web development, providing the structure of web pages that users navigate on the internet.
    Without HTML, the web would not have its foundational structure.</p>

  <h6>Benefits of CSS</h6>
  <p>CSS offers web designers a solution to maintain consistency across different screen sizes, devices, and browsers.
    It also allows for a separation of content from design, enabling a more streamlined and efficient web design
    process.</p>
